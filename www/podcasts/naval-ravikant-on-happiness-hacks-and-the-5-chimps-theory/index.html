  <h1>Naval Ravikant on Happiness Hacks and the 5 Chimps Theory</h1>
  <p>Naval Ravikant shares his thoughts on life in Tim Ferris&#39;s <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/01/30/naval-ravikant-on-happiness-hacks/" target="_blank">podcast</a>. Very insightful and deep answers - I hightly recommend it. Here is what I&#39;ve found particularly interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regarding general purpose AI: today we’re writing similar code to what we’ve written in the past but it’s been executed faster or it’s working with more data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The best way to prepare for the future in 20 years is find something you love to do.
Build an independent brand around it with your name.
Make creative work, so that you stay interesting, you can stay ahead of the game.
Anything that is not creative society can replicate and not pay you full value overtime, so it’s better always solving new problems and doing new things.
Get comfortable with working in a boom/bust fashion where a couple of weeks at a time you can have a lot of work and then a couple of weeks at a time you’re on vacation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The future will be gradual and then it will be sudden. The best way to prepare is just not to give up your independence in a first place.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;You have two lives. The second one begins when you realize you only have one.&quot; ― Confucius</p>
</li>
<li><p>The more worldly success you have the more your ego gets built up the more fearful you might be at loosing it all  the more you care what other people think the more you get caught up in this dream of who you think you are.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your children probably will not need to know how to drive a car.</p>
</li>
<li><p>True happiness comes out of peace. And peace comes out of fundamentally understanding yourself. It comes from looking inside yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Say yes to everything that happens.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We’re used to constantly judging things and the act of judging things separates you from that thing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The act of judging something separates you from that thing. Overtime as you judge, judge, judge, you invariably judge people, you judge yourself. You separate yourself from everything and then you end up lonely. That feeling of disconnection, loneliness is what eventually leads to suffering. And then you struggle, you resist the world the way it is. Happiness is the absence of suffering. It comes from peace.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The most important trick to be happy is to realise that happiness is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make. You choose to be happy and then you work at it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t hang around people who constantly engaging in conflict.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A lot of struggle that we have in life comes from a deep fear of death. This fear can take a form of us wanting to achieve something. A lot of that comes from this fear that we’re going to die and we have to build something that can last beyond us.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t have a quest for immortality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The universe has been around for a long time. We’re not important on a scale of the universe. We don’t really matter that much. Nothing that we do lasts. Eventually you will fade, your work will fade, your children will fade, your thoughts will fade, this planet will fade, the sun will fade.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enjoy yourself. Don’t take life too seriously. Nothing that you do will matter that much in a long run. Don’t take yourself so seriously.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The purpose of life for Naval at this time is to keep growing and learning in this short period of time that you have. To seek truth and to accept things the way they are. To see the world the way it really is. And then just to live your life.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enjoy your life. Try to see the things the way they truly are not the way you wish they were. To be in harmony with things the way they are.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Humans are habit machines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning how to break habits is very important metaskill that can serve you better in life than almost anything else.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;I choose to live free and spontaneous life. I don’t want to live very structured life.
I don’t plan. I am not a planner. I prefer to live in a moment and be free and flow and be happy.
Projecting too much in a future, judging yourself, micromanaging yourself - all you’re going to do is make yourself miserable.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Focus on one or two really important things and surrender to everything else. Just take it as it comes, just accept it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Study psychology and evolution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Focus on theory and principles over facts, because facts fade or can be looked up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have a good grasp of mathematics and if you like to read - there is nothing you can’t learn on your own.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to a hub for whatever your industry is.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Individual entrepreneurial efforts often fail, but individual entrepreneurs over their careers rarely fail. As long as you can keep taking shots on goal and you keep getting back up eventually you’ll get through.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I am not going to say Yes or No. I am going to say Hell Yes or No. Unless I am really excited about something - I am not going to do it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All the great outcomes in life come from compound interest: whether it’s investing or relationships.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you can’t see yourself working with somebody for life - don’t work with them for a day.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Treat a lot of your time as a search function - where you’re searching through the set of jobs, you’re searching through the set of dates, spouses, you’re searching through the set of friends, you’re searching through the set of hobbies until you find things you love. And when you find things and people that you love you go all in on them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>5 chimps theory: choose your 5 friends carefully.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s really important to have empty space. If you don’t have a day or two days a week in your calendar where you’re not always in meetings and you’re not always busy then you’re not going to be able to think you’re not going to be able to have good ideas for your business, you’re not going to have good judgement. Take at least 1 day a week, preferably 2 days a week where you have nothing on your calendar and you just have time to think. <code>It’s only after you’re bored that you’re going to have good ideas.</code> It’s never going to be when you’re stressed or busy or running around or rushed. Make the time. Same way with people. You need to have space in your life where you’re not booked with the people that you already know. You have to be pretty ruthless about saying no to things, about turning people down and leaving room in your life for serendipity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Guard your time. It’s all you have.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should have systems in life and you should look for patterns. That way you’re not bound to any specific outcome. If you have a system given all the randomness in the world the system will eventually pull signal out of the noise, it will overwhelm the randomness and let you get to your goal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You’ve got to have a system because the world is really random.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bad news come suddenly, but good news takes time. Good things in your life develop slowly over time because you have systems and that’s out there to catch them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
