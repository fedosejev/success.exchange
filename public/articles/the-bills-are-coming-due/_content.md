<a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/12/the-bills-are-coming-due.aspx" target="_blank">This article</a> by Morgan Housel is a good moral support for times when stocks are down. Here is what I've leant:

+ 13% of people who own stocks say they have little-to-no tolerance for significant market declines. Where significant is 5% to 10% drop.

+ A better way to describe 5% to 10% drop is: "the kind of thing that will likely happen several times a year for as long as you own stocks".

+ The People's Republic of Expensive Advice. Fees paid for investment products underperforming their benchmark exceeds half a trillion dollars per year.

+ The biggest investment fees are intangible. They're the ones you pay through `anxiety` and `uncertainty`.

+ An iron rule of life is that if you want something nice, you have to pay for it.

+ You, the investor, have to be willing to put up with market declines.

+ High returns without much effort - an idea capitalism smashes with a vengeance. 

+ "There's no system to avoid bad markets. You can't do it unless you try to time the market, which is a seriously dumb thing to do. Conservative investing with steady savings without expecting miracles is the way to go." - Charlie Munger

+ "The stock market doesn't owe you anything. It doesn't care that you're about to retire. It doesn't care that you're funding your child's education. It doesn't care about your wants and needs or your hopes and dreams." - [Michael Batnick](http://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2016/02/10/you-are-owed-nothing/)

+ "This is called investing and the price of admission is gut wrenching drawdowns and sometimes years and years with nothing to show for it. If you can accept that this is the way things work, you can be an enormously successful investor." - [Michael Batnick](http://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2016/02/10/you-are-owed-nothing/)
