+ One should have a system instead of a goal.

+ Goals are for loosers (bluntly put).

+ If you achieve your goal, you celebrate and feel terrific, but only until you realize you just lost the thing that gave you purpose and direction.

+ Presuccess failure - stage before you actually achieve your goal.

+ Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous presuccess failure at best, and permenent failure at worst if things never work out.

+ Systems people succeed every time they apply their systems, in the sense that they did what they intended to do.

+ The systems people are feeling good every time they apply their system.

+ In the world of dieting, losing twenty pounds is a goal, but eating right is a system.

+ In business, making a million dollars is a goal, but being a serial entrepreneur is a system.

+ A goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or dont' sometime in the future. A system if something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happinessin the long run.

+ If you do something everyday, it's a system.

+ If you're waiting to achieve it someday in he future, it's a goal.

+ Goals are reach-it-and-be-done situations, whereas a system is something you do on a regular basis with a reasonable expectation that doing so will get you to a better place in your life. Systems have no deadlines, and on any given day you probably can't tell if they're moving you in the right direction.

+ System beats passion every time.
