I found that learnign from Gary is a great investment of my time. Here is what I've learnt from the talk he gave at <a href="http://digsouth.com/" target="_blank">Dig South Interactive Conference</a> 2015: 

+ `The single way to sell, succeed, build your business is to follow the attention. The attention is what matters.` Understanding what to say is the single most important thing, but if you don’t know where to say it - it doesn’t fucking matter. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=9m44s

+ Where is your actual consumer? https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=10m03s

+ It all starts as kids. Facebook was kids. Twitter was tech kids. `It all starts as kids and then it ages up.` https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=13m8s

+ The reason you need to be there (on a new platform) right away is not because you’re going to sell something, it’s because the entire tech and mainstream media wants to write articles about new platforms and if you happen to be there... You’ll get more exposure, more leverage. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=16m34s

+ If you’re a startup, if you under 10 employees, evertime a new platform that comes out that gets any level of buzz you need to spend every goddamn minute on it. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=17m8s

+ If you think about it: Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat - all of these products are content-push-out platforms. In essence they’re CMS. `Twitter is one place where we still can engage, where people are actually have conversations.` https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=21m58s

+ Because all the money in the content-push-out, Twitter is positioning the product as a content-push-out, meanwhile it’s a place where you can get into the conversation.

+ I spend a ton of time listening to what people are talking about that I am trying to get to on Twitter, and then putting out content that I think matters to them around that subject on Facebook, Instagram, etc. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=22m38s

+ If you don’t recognise that you’re a media company first and then you do what you do for a living - you’re making a huge mistake going into the next half decade. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=23m11s

+ Media is a gateway drug to sales. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=24m21s

+ My team writes an article with the following headline: “5 Wines You Should Drink If You Graduated from the University of Princeton”. Then we went to Facebook and created an ad and we targeted people that live in NJ, are interested in wine and graduated from the university of fucking Princeton. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=24m30s

+ Everyone of you needs to audit tomorrow what’s the b2b magazine that the customer that you’re trying to reach is reading and you need to try to put them out of business. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=26m38s

+ Uber, AirBnB, InstaCart, all these companies are not anomalies - they’re just a preview. Software is eating the World. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=27m29s

+ The companies that are solving inefficiencies in our society with software - have just began. There is enormous opportunity. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=28m0s

+ The things that everybody values the most are:

  1. The health and wellbeing of your family.
  2. Money.
  3. Time.

  Time is the asset that is going to be arbitraged to build tons of billion dollar companies over the next decade.

  There is a race by entrepreneurs to go out and try to solve inefficient problems that sell you back time. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=28m14s

+ 70% of people in the audience will have Apple Watch in 24 to 36 months for one reason: it’s going to save you time.

  Wearables on your body will have you time. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=33m6s

+ 25-35% of people actually get mad when other human being calls them. Because people recognise how valuable their time is: why are you calling me on your time - you don’t know what I am doing - text me and I’ll get back to you when it’s mine time. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=35m41s

+ People react very heavily to the truth. https://youtu.be/Rpi9PBr1hA0?t=52m19s
